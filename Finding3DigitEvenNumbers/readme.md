## Finding 3-Digit Even Numbers

algorithms Easy (54.08%)

You are given an integer array digits, where each element is a digit. The array may contain duplicates.

You need to find all the unique integers that follow the given requirements:

The integer consists of the concatenation of three elements from digits in any arbitrary order.

The integer does not have leading zeros.<br>
The integer is even.<br>
For example, if the given digits were [1, 2, 3], integers 132 and 312 follow the requirements.

Return a sorted array of the unique integers.

**Example 1:**

Input: digits = [2,1,3,0]<br>
Output: [102,120,130,132,210,230,302,310,312,320]<br>
Explanation: All the possible integers that follow the requirements are in the output array. <br>
Notice that there are no odd integers or integers with leading zeros.<br>

**Example 2:**

Input: digits = [2,2,8,8,2]<br>
Output: [222,228,282,288,822,828,882]<br>
Explanation: The same digit can be used as many times as it appears in digits. <br>
In this example, the digit 8 is used twice each time in 288, 828, and 882. <br><br>
**Example 3:**

Input: digits = [3,7,5]<br>
Output: []<br>
Explanation: No even integers can be formed using the given digits.<br>

**Constraints:**

3 <= digits.length <= 100<br>
0 <= digits[i] <= 9
